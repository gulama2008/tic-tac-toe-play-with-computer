- If the player choose the PVC mode, he will be playing with the computer. The player will make move first, and the computer will make a optimised move automatically after the player's move. The one who is the first to get 3 of the marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. When the game ends, there will be a message showing which side has won, or if the game is in a tie, with two options of quit the game or play a new game.

- If the player choose the PVP mode, two players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The rest of the rules are the same.

## Future Goals
- Use better algorithms (miniMax algorithm) to re-write the logic for the computer
